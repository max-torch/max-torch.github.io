I added a "visualize data" feature to a time tracking app. The app is called [Time Tracker](https://github.com/pazitos10/time-tracker?msclkid=45d90970a6db11ec97e3aed8d182a06a). I had to learn how to use the PyQt GUI library so that I could add the menu options for generating the data visualizations.

Here is the specific [GitHub PR](https://github.com/Pazitos10/time-tracker/pull/3) that shows my feature contribution.
