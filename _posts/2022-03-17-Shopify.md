My sisters are selling handmade jewelry through their business called [Hola said Lola](https://holasaidlola.com), which uses Shopify as its e-commerce platform. My little contribution to their business was to make a dashboard for them. The dashboard fetches data from the Shopify Store database through the use of [Shopify's REST API](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest?msclkid=a95a5618a6d811ec959394708f75e4fa#top). The dashboard is made using the Plotly Dash library. The figures are made using the Plotly Express library. In order to showcase this as an example on my portfolio, I had to create a fake dataset for it, and I deployed it online on Heroku.
