This a slideshow presentation which I have used to give an overview of Data Science, from the types of data all the way to how data scientists run computational experiments to choose and refine their models.

The slideshow can be viewed online [here using nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/max-torch/Data-Science-Introduction/blob/main/Presentation.slides.html#/).

Work Skills showcased in this article:
* Creating a Slideshow Presentation from a Jupyter Notebook
* Embedding Interactive Elements in a Slideshow
* Understanding of the steps in the Data Science Process
