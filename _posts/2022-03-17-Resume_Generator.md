This is the Python script that I use to generate my own resume. Since it's hosted on GitHub, if you like the format you can make use of it as well. 

Initially, I write my resume using Markdown. Next, I convert it to HTML using a VSCode extension. Next, I give it some aesthetic style using CSS. Next, the HTML is converted to a PDF. Finally, Git version control allows me manage different versions of my resume for sending to different employers.
